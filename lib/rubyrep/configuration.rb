    # General options.
    # Possible settings:
    # * :+proxy_block_size+: The proxy cursor will calculate the checksum for block_size number of records each.
    # * :+row_buffer_size+:
    #   The number of rows that is read into memory at once.
    #   Only needed for database drivers that don't stream results one-by-one to the client.
    # * :+committer+:
    #   A committer key as registered by Committers#register.
    #   Determines the transaction management to be used during the sync.
    # * :+commit_frequency+:
    #   Used by BufferedCommitter. Number of changes after which the open
    #   transactions should be committed and new transactions be started.
    # * :+table_ordering+:
    #   If true, sort tables before syncing as per foreign key dependencies.
    #   (Dependent tables are synced last to reduce risk of foreign key
    #   constraint violations.)
    # * :+scan_progress_printer+:
    #   The progress printer key as registered by ScanProgressPrinters#register.
    #   Determines how the scan progress is visualized.
    # * :+use_ansi+: Only use ANSI codes for text output if +true+.
    # * :+auto_key_limit+:
    #   If a table has no primary keys and no primary keys have been specified
    #   manually using the :+primary_key_names+ option, then this option can be
    #   activated to simply use all columns of the table as a big combined key.
    #   This option specifies up to how many columns a table may have in order
    #   to use them as one big, combined primary key.
    #   Typical use case: the database has a lot of tables to map many-to-many
    #   relationshipts and no combined primary key is set up for them.
    # Sync specific settings
    # * :+before_table_sync+:
    #   A hook that is executed before a table sync.
    #   Can be either
    #   * a String: executed as SQL command on both databases.
    #   * a Proc:
    #     Called once before the table sync.
    #     The Proc is called with one parameter: the current SyncHelper instance.
    #     Through the sync helper there is access to the name of the synced table,
    #     the current session, etc
    #     Example:
    #     lambda {|helper| $stderr.puts "Hook called for #{helper.left_table}."}
    # * :+after_table_sync+:
    #   Same as :+before_table_sync+ (but called after the sync is completed).
    # * :+syncer+:
    #   A syncer key as registered by TableSync#register_syncer.
    #   Determines which sync algorithm is used.
    # * further options as defined by each syncer
    # Replication specific settings:
    # * :+rep_prefix+: the prefix that is put in front of all created database objects
    # * :+key_sep+: which string separates columns in the key column of the change log table
    # * :+replicator+:
    #   Determines which replicator algorithm to use.
    #   For each replicator must also exist a corresponding +:syncer+. (It is
    #   used for the initial sync of a table.)
    #   If no +:syncer+ option is specified, than a syncer as named by this
    #   option is used.
    # * :+adjust_sequences+:
    #   If true, adjust sequences to avoid number conflicts between left and
    #   right database during replication.
    # * :+sequence_adjustement_buffer+:
    #   When updating a sequence, this is the additional gap to avoid sequence
    #   conflicts to appear due to concurrent record insertions.
    # * :+sequence_increment+: new sequence value = last sequence value + this
    # * :+left_sequence_offset+, +right_sequence_offset+:
    #   Default sequence offset for the table in the according data base.
    #   E. g. with a +sequence_increment+ of 2, an offset of 0 will produce even,
    #   an offset of 1 will produce odd numbers.
    # * :+replication_interval+: time in seconds between replication runs
    # * :+database_connection_timeout+:
    #   Time in seconds after which database connections time out.
    # * :+:after_infrastructure_setup+:
    #   A Proc that is called after the replication infrastructure tables are
    #   set up. Useful to e. g. tweak the access settings for the table.
    #   The block is called with the current Session object.
    #   The block is called every time replication is started, even if the
    #   the infrastructure tables already existed.
    #
    # Example of an :+after_infrastructure_setup+ handler:
    #   lambda do |session|
    #     [:left, :right].each do |database|
    #       session.send(database).execute "GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT ON rr_pending_changes TO scott"
